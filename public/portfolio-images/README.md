# Portfolio Images Folder

This folder contains all portfolio images that will be displayed on the website.

## How to Add Images

1. Simply add your image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.avif`) to this folder
2. The images will automatically appear on the portfolio page
3. Images are sorted alphabetically by filename
4. The image title will be derived from the filename (without extension)

## Supported Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)
- AVIF (.avif)

## Notes

- Images are automatically loaded when you add them to this folder
- No code changes needed - just add the files and refresh the page
- Make sure image filenames don't contain special characters that might cause issues
- For best results, use descriptive filenames as they will be used as image titles
